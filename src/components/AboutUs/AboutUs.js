              Moulvibazar eye hospital is working with a view to giving vision
              to the sight-disabled. This hospital is working not only with the
              poor people of Moulvibazar district but also the people of greater
              Sylhet. Nobody has ever returned without treatment of a curable
              disease. The poorest man of the society is also getting free
              modern treatment. The idea of not having treatment for money is
              quite wrong here in <b>Moulvibazar Eye Hospital</b>.

              Blindness is a worldwide phenomenon of human disability. It is a
              problem that is much more widespread in the developing country
              like Bangladesh. Blindness is defined as the inability to perceive
              light. Bangladesh, a country of approximately 140,000,000 of
              population occupies one of the most density populated areas in the
              world. About 1% of total population is blind. Added to this
              another 60,000 people become blind every year.

              <b>Bangladesh National Society for the Blind (BNSB)</b> is a
              voluntary, non-governmental organization, started its journey
              against blindness in 1972. To work for visually handicapped people
              BNSB Moulvibazar joined in the fight against blindness in 1981 and
              extended up to 25 beds in 1986. Now it is a 31 bedded specialized
              hospital.

              In Sylhet Division there was not a specialized hospital except
              Sylhet M.A.G Osmani Medical College Hospital. In the initial stage
              Sylhet division has the one way health facilities through Sylhet
              M.A.G Osmani Medical College Hospital. So, it was very difficult
              to provide health facility including the eye care service to the
              8,000,000 population of Sylhet division.

              Nurul Islam and other local philanthropists came forward with a
              vision - SIGHT TO SEE, and established Moulvibazar BNSB Eye
              Hospital.
